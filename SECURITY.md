We encourage responsible disclosure, where vulnerabilities are reported privately to us before being publicly disclosed. This allows us to address the issue promptly and minimize any potential harm.

### **Bounty Program**

We currently do not offer a bounty program for security vulnerability reports. However, we may consider implementing one in the future.

### **Additional Resources**

For more information on secure coding practices and reporting vulnerabilities, please refer to the following resources:

* **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP):** [https://owasp.org/](https://owasp.org/)
* **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework:** [https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)

**Specific Considerations for ADBugger:**

Given ADBugger's focus on interacting with Android devices and emulators, it's essential to consider the following security implications:

* **Device Permissions:** Ensure that ADBugger requests only the necessary permissions from users to perform its functions.
* **Data Privacy:** Handle any user data collected by ADBugger securely and in compliance with relevant privacy regulations.
* **Network Security:** Implement measures to protect against network attacks, such as unauthorized access or data interception.
* **Third-Party Dependencies:** If using third-party libraries or components, carefully evaluate their security practices and vulnerabilities.

**By addressing these considerations, we can help to ensure the security and privacy of ADBugger users.**
